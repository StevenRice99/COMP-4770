# Overview

Easy AI was created to allow for easily creating intelligent agents in Unity without a need for a deep understanding of Unity itself. Easy AI handles all boilerplate such as agent movement, cameras, and a GUI rendering automatically so you can focus on developing the behaviour of your agents and let Easy AI take care of the rest. This library is mainly intended for teaching and learning purposes that emphasizes a distinct separation between agents and their sensors, actuators, and minds, as well as the percepts and actions which allow these components to communicate. In a production environment, you would instead most likely want to create specifically optimized agents that directly have access to their required information abd thus Easy AI is not recommended for use directly in a production environment but its core logic can still be used as a starting point for specialized agents.

# Features

- Three types of agents allowing for movement either by directly moving the transform, using a character controller, or using a rigidbody.
  - Transform agents will move directly towards a position without colliding and do not have any gravity.
  - Character agents move using a character controller where gravity is calculated and applied. They will collide with objects but do not push them.
  - Rigidbody agents move using a rigidbody with gravity automatically applied. They collide with and push objects.
- Agents will automatically collect all sensors, actuators, and minds attached to them meaning you do not need to worry about forgetting to assign any references in the inspector.
- An agent manager handles all agents which allows for limiting how many agents are updated during a single frame meaning you can use Easy AI even if you have a lot of agents in the scene or your computer is older.
  - Agent movement is kept smooth regardless of agent thinking limits ensuring everything runs smoothly.
- A built in messaging system which allows for displaying messages on the GUI for ease of seeing exactly what your agents are performing at any given moment.
- The built in GUI allows for selecting every agent, sensor, and actuator in the scene so you can see their exact details and messages.
- Several included cameras.
  - A camera type to look at the currently selected agent from a fixed position.
  - A camera type to follow the currently selected agent from behind and zoom in and out.
  - A camera type to track the currently selected agent from above and zoom in and out.
  - All cameras are selectable from the built in GUI which handles ensuring they are all focused on the currently selected agent.
- Easily implement methods for drawing lines directly to the screen so you can further visualize what your agents are doing.
- The built in GUI includes controls to easily play, pause, and step through a single time step.
- Fully documented source code under the MIT licence.

# Installation

You can install Easy AI either through the package manager or by manually downloading it as a ZIP and adding it to your project, with the package manager being the recommended mode of installation.

## Package Manager

*Note this method requires you have GIT installed on your computer.*

1. Click the "Code" button above and under "Clone", copy the https URL.
2. Open your Unity project and go to "Window > Package Manager" and hit the "+" icon in the top left of the Package Manager window followed by "Add package from git URL..." and paste in the link you copied in step one. This will automatically install the [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.1/manual/index.html "Input System") dependency.

## Manually

1. Click the "Code" button above and click "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Open your Unity project and go to "Window > Package Manager" and hit the "+" icon in the top left of the Package Manager window followed by "Add package from disk..." and navigate to the extracted package where you must select the "package.json" file. This should automatically install the [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.1/manual/index.html "Input System") dependency, however, only the package manager method has been tested, so if may need to be manually installed.
   1. Alternatively, you could simply add all ".cs" files into anywhere in your "Assets" folder. If you choose to do so this way, you will have to manually install the [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.1/manual/index.html "Input System") dependency.

# Dependencies

- Requires at least Unity 2021.3.
- Requires Unity's [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.1/manual/index.html "Input System") for zooming in and out with the included cameras.
- Requires Unity's [Mathematics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.mathematics@1.1/manual/index.html "Mathematics") package for use with nodes and navigation.
